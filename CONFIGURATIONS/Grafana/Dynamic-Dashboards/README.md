# ðŸ§© How to Create a Dynamic Dashboard in Grafana (Wazuh Agents Example)

## 1. Set Up a Variable

First, go to the **dashboard settings** of the one you want to make dynamic â€” this will be the dashboard where data updates based on the selected variable.

* Navigate to **Settings â†’ Variables**.
* Click on **Add variable**.
* Fill in the details. In this example, we have 3 Wazuh agents.

Now create a panel and use the variable in the query. As shown below, the `agent_id` selected is `001`, thanks to the variable setup.
