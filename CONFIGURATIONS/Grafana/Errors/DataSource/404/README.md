## 2. The Solution

This issue is easy to fix â€” itâ€™s usually caused by the index name not matching the actual index in your data source.

**Steps to fix:**

1. Go to **Dashboard Settings â†’ Data Source**.
2. Find the **Index Name** field.
3. Change it to the correct index name.
4. *(Tip)* You can keep the same name but make a **minimal change** to simulate an update (e.g., add a space, save, then remove it).

âœ… After saving, refresh the dashboard and the error should be gone.
