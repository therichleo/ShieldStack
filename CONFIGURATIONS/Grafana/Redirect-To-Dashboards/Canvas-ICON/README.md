I made this cause, add a link to an icon at canvas before it was so difficult (but is so easy)

1. In the first we are gonna press the icon and add a link

2. The final part or second and the most important is this, because if we press the icon, the link is not working, so we need to go to the panel in the canvas seccion and desabilite "inlline editing" this is gonna do the icon with link work
