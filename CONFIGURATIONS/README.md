# 🛠️ ShieldStack – Configuration

This folder contains detailed configuration steps, common issues, and undocumented solutions encountered during the deployment and scaling of the **ShieldStack** security monitoring architecture.

The goal of this section is to provide clear guidance where official documentation was lacking, incomplete, or misleading — based entirely on real-world implementation during deployment at the **Municipality of Pedro Aguirre Cerda**.

Each subfolder includes screenshots, notes, and fixes that were tested and successfully implemented. These resources are intended to help others replicate, troubleshoot, and understand the full system setup.
