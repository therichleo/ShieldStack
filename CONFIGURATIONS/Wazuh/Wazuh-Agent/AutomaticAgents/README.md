in firstly we have to go to the route of manage_agents
i am in docker single-node so we enter in the wazuh-manager with docker exec -it single-node-wazuh-manager-01 /bin/bash
then go to ./var/ossec/bin/manage_agents
and is gona appears a display that is like that:
<img width="422" height="232" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7441332f-0b6b-4e5f-962c-8f1cbea18e22" />
so we put A
the name is just a random name or a name that we like
and for the IP if you dont have static IPs just put "any"
