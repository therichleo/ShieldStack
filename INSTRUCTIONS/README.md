This intructions makes the conections from Wazuh to Grafana, so in midst of this is ElasticSearch/OpenSearch, FileBeat and Kibana

You can start like you want, but in my case I start with Wazuh.

Firstly we are gonna start wazuh with dockers, if you dont have docker, dont take the risk and search in this repository docker installation

So once we have docker-compose installed, we have start with this command 

``` git clone https://github.com/wazuh/wazuh-docker.git -b v4.12.0 ```
