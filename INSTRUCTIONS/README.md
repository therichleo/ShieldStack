This intructions makes the conections from Wazuh to Grafana, so in midst of this is ElasticSearch/OpenSearch, FileBeat and Kibana

You can start like you want, but in my case I start with Wazuh.

Firstly we are gonna start wazuh with dockers, if you dont have docker, dont take the risk and search in this repository docker installation
